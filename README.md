## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to showcase how to create a canvas element in HTML and use JavaScript to control the movement of an object within that canvas. The canvas provides a 2D drawing surface on which we can dynamically render graphical elements.

## Installation
To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/2dcanvas.git

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the index.html file in a web browser. This will load the HTML page that contains the canvas and the object.

The object starts at a fixed position within the canvas and moves within a specified finite space. The movement is controlled using JavaScript, which updates the object's position and redraws it on the canvas.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different object movements or canvas configurations to suit your needs.
